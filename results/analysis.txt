clone:
    takes about 37000 cycles.
    18000 cycles is the clone itself.
    then it takes another 1000 cycles to get to waitpid
    until we arrive at the entry-point, it takes another 13000 cycles

read:
    each 4K read costs about 12000 cycles. 3000 cycles are Linux overhead, 9000 cycles
    are for the data-copy.
    12000 * (2M / 4K) = 12000 * 512 = 6144000
